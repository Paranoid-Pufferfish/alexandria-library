# NamePending
## Concept
NamePending is a University library management platform designed to optimize the process of renting and returning books, providing a REST API Microservice & a Webapp Interface for both administrating and managing books and rents, making it possible to integrate in other environnements, and developing native desktop/phone apps.

## Needs Analysis
- A student/professor interface for managing rented books, showing delays and warnings, and offering the possibility to extend delays.
- An admin/staff interface for both assigning books to students/professors, adding books to the inventory, and check logs and events.
- Possibility of creating a student/professor account without staff intervention.
- Guest access is also possible to check for availability of a book/piece of work.
- Importing and Exporting Data in a CSV/SQLite format.
- A simple and advanced search interface (FTS5 for partial matches).
- Getting book infos from the ISBN13 using public APIs (OPTIONAL).
- Possibility of scanning a books codebar to autofill its infos (OPTIONAL).
